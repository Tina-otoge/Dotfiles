echo i3 is a window manager. i3 is not a desktop environment.

echo as a program to manage your windows.
echo What differentiate i3 from other more known window managers is that i3
echo manages your windows as tiles. It does not draw draggable windows on a
echo desktop. It splits your screen in tiles to draw windows in them.
echo i3-gaps is a modified version of i3 that adds some more configuration
echo options, including the ability to add gaps between window.
echo
echo Other popular desktop environments are GNOME, KDE, XFCE \(default on the
